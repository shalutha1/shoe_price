# Shoe Price Predictor
 üî∑ Excited to share my latest project - Shoe Price Prediction! üíé

I've leveraged the power of Python, Scikit-learn, and Flask to predict diamond prices based on features like carat, cut, color, and clarity. The implementation incorporates robust logging and exception handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

Here are some key highlights:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing**: Efficient handling of missing values, outliers, and categorical data encoding.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Modeling**: Utilized Scikit-learn's Pipeline for a seamless and efficient workflow.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using Mean MSE, and Std Dev Score.
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Logging**: Implemented comprehensive logging to track the application flow and aid in debugging.
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Exception Handling**: Robust exception handling to manage any errors or exceptions during program execution.
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Web Application**: Developed a user-friendly Flask web application for users to input diamond features and receive price predictions.

The tech stacks used for this project include:
 -Python
 -Scikit-Learn
 -Pandas
 -Numpy
 -Flask
 -Matplotlib
 -Pipeline
